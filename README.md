# Ascii_Game_Engine--C-plus-plus
Built a modular ASCII game engine in C++ using ncurses, emphasizing clean design and ease of use. Implemented continuous collision detection for smooth gameplay and applied object-oriented patterns like Strategy to enable flexible, dynamic entity behavior.

## Example Games

To demonstrate and validate the functionality of the game engine, two sample games were developed using the engine: **Space Invaders** and **Flappy Bird**.

These examples serve as testbeds for the engine’s core features and design.

### Running the Games

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the project by running:
   ```bash
   make
3. Execute either of the following binaries:
   ```bash
